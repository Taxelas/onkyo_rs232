# onkyo_rs232
Onkyo receiver control over rs 232
My first projet in python to control my receiver via rs232.
I use console server(mikrotic router) to connect to rs232 receiver via ssh.
I want to run mqtt2onkyo python script on my raspberry PI and connect it to my home assistant.

Working  on connecting it to mqtt broker
